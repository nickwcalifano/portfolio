### ML/AI Portfolio

I've written some examples projects highlighting a variety of machine learning techniques. The projects are written to be a discussion of the techniques rather than an optimized application. 

The performance (accuracy) of these methods is often acceptable but not spectacular due to intentionally using small datasets and small models. The goal of this portfolio is to show competency with these techniques, not results. 

### Examples
