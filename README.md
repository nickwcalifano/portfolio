### ML/AI Portfolio

This portfolio is comprised of examples projects intended to highlight a variety of machine learning techniques and simulate a number of discussions with stakeholders. The projects are intentionally written to be a demonstration and discussion (almost like a presentation) rather than an optimized application.

The performance of these methods is often acceptable but not spectacular due to intentionally using small datasets, small models, and small compute resources (my personal computer). The goal of this portfolio is to show competency with these techniques, not state-of-the-art results. 

### Examples
| Example          | Demonstration of:                                   | Simulated Discussions with Stakeholders   |
