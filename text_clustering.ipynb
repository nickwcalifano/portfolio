    "\n",
    "I perform a similar dimensionality reduction, but only using only the samples of interest so the mappings are better tuned to the remaining samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "I found that DBSCAN did not perform well on this subset of the data. While tuning the parameters it tended to do one of the following: label everything noise, label a substantial proportion noise and create 1-2 large clusters, or label nothing noise and create 1-2 large clusters. I performed hyperparameter tuning on UMAP's n_components and n_neighbors as well as DBSCAN's eps and min_samples. There were a small subset of hyperparameters that would have ~6 clusters. But the clusters didn't seem to be particularly meaningful. This may be because the first round of clustering got all the high density clusters, and DBSCAN looks for high density volumes to seed clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "After DBSCAN didn't work, I turned to K-means clustering. Sklearn's implementation of K-means doesn't support weighted samples, so I just repeated samples based on the number of likes. I found that the raw number of likes was not great for this. Using the number of likes to be the sample weighted didn't work well. The top 10 comments have almost a 3rd of the total likes, so if we use the number of likes as the sample weighting, then the top N comments essentially become the centers for the clusters. The clusters then lose meaning because they are severely overfit on the most liked samples. To adjust this, I created a sublinear weighting function. The idea behind it is that we still want the number of likes to guide the clusters, but not directly proportionally. The sublinear function is linear from 1 to 10 (thanks to integer rounding), but then diverges more and more from a linear function. A comment with 100 likes has a weight of 62. The most liked comment has 114k likes, but only has a weight of 607.\n",
    "\n",
    "After trying some values for clusters between 10 and 100, I found that 40 gave interpretable results. If anything, 40 is probably too many clusters. However, it felt relatively easy to identify trends in the clusters by looking at the top comments and top TF-IDF topics (discussed below). By skimming many comments from each cluster, I was able to confirm that the top comments and TF-IDF topics were representative of the entire cluster for the most part. The purpose of clustering was to find trends in the comments without having to read tens of thousands of comments. While 40 clusters is still quite a bit of work to go through, it is at least manually tractible. If we needed many more clusters (say 400 instead of 40), I would have implemented other tricks to combine clusters."

    "\n",
    "TF-IDF has two terms Term Frequency (TF) and Inverse Document Frequency (IDF).\n",
    "* TF measures how often a topic appears in a comment - a topic is just an ngram in this case. I use ngrams of length 1, 2 and 3. It was uncommon for topics with 4+ words to score highly. Since the comments are so short, I use binary TF which just means 0/1 for does this topic appear in this comment at least once.\n",
    "* IDF is a normalization measure. Certain topics like \"he was\" are going to appear in many many comments. The IDF normalizes those topics to make the TF-IDF an importance measure.\n",
    "* As an example, if you run the TF-IDF on Shakespeare's 37 plays:\n",
    "    * You'll find the word \"Romeo\" only appears in one play, but it appears 130 times. So the word \"Romeo\" is both only present in a small number of documents (only 1 play), but it comes up a lot in that play. So its TF-IDF score is very high, and we would call that a topic.\n",
    "    * The word \"Falstaff\" is in 4 plays, and in one play appears 46 times. This would have a lower, but still quite high score. It might be a less prevalent topic.\n",
    "    * The word \"fool\" appears in 36 of the 37 plays, and in a large proportion of the plays it appears less than 10 times. Since the word \"fool\" appears in almost every play, it is just a word that Shakespeare likes. It is not a topic of any of those plays.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get the topics of each cluster, we can perform the IDF step on all comments, then perform the TF step on just the current cluster. Then we can sum the TFs across the comments of the current cluster and get the TF-IDF score of this cluster normalized across all comments.\n",
    "\n",
    "TF-IDF can have a problem with noise. To combat noise, we only consider a topic if it appears in more than 20 comments, but less than 10% of all comments (something like \"he is\" might appear in many comments and won't be represenative). We also don't want to consider stop words like \"the\", \"a\", \"on\", etc. There are some other tricks like lowercasing that are used as well. I also "
